                <p>As a valued member of our community, we trust you to use your purchased key responsibly. Any attempts to distribute, share, or sell your key without explicit permission from our administration team, which includes Admins and higher-ranking members, may result in the immediate suspension or revocation of your key privileges. This ensures the integrity and security of our platform and protects the interests of all our users.</p>
                <p>Additionally, if your key is found to be in violation of our terms of service or is associated with any form of misconduct, it may be subject to blacklisting or suspension. In such cases, you may be required to purchase a new key to regain access to our premium features. Account sharing, whether intentional or unintentional, is strictly forbidden and can result in the immediate suspension of your key. We take the security of our platform seriously and enforce strict measures to protect the integrity of our community. It is imperative that you keep your key confidential and refrain from sharing it with anyone else to prevent any unauthorized access or misuse of our services.</p>
                <p>For the time being, due to security risks, we are only accepting Robux as payment for our premium key. However, we are exploring the possibility of migrating to PayPal or Cash App in the near future, which will provide more flexibility and convenience for our users. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work towards enhancing our payment methods.</p>
                <p>It's important to note that attempting to bypass a blacklist, whether by creating a new account or using alternative methods, will result in immediate termination of access. Please be aware that in such circumstances, refunds will not be issued for attempted re-purchases of the premium key.</p>
                <p>Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in upholding our community standards and policies. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our policies, please don't hesitate to contact our support team for assistance.</p>
